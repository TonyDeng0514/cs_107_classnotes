Objects in CS
  Used to represent items involved in an algorithm
  Two major components
    methods (i.e., behaviors)
    properties (i.e., state)
    
Juggling algorithm:

# Objects: Hands and Balls.
# Properties: for hands: we have throw() and catch(), and display/set output.

 # assume that there's only one of of throwing
 # the balls, which is from one hand to the other 
 # hand.
 
lefthand.throw(ball[0]) # initialize with throwing the first ball

# iteration of throwing balls
for i in range(3):
  righthand.throw(ball[i + 1])
  righthand.catch(ball[i])
  lefthand.throw(ball[i + 2])
  lefthand.catch(ball[i + 1])
  
  
The underscores are there so that people don't mistakenly use a researved method.
